Nowadays, when we aim to gather code coverage in .NET, tools such as ``Coverlet``, ``Report Generator``, ``dotnet-coverage``, ``dotCover`` and ``OpenCover`` or even ``Visual Studio`` are among the most frequently used.

There is also a range of SaaS products where you can submit the code coverage metrics of your .NET applications and monitor them. Some of the most renowned are ``SonarQube`` and ``CodeCov``.

If you're collecting code coverage in a CI/CD runner like ``Azure DevOps`` or ``GitHub Actions``, you can publish a summary of the code coverage in the actual pipeline. This allows you, for example, to view the code coverage results when you open a Pull Request.

I believe it would be useful to take a look at the services mentioned above, as this can help us gain a clearer understanding of the current landscape when we aim to to collect code coverage in .NET.

But first, allow me to briefly explain what code coverage is.

# **Code Coverage**

Code coverage is a metric that can help you understand how much of your source code is tested. It's a metric that can help you assess the quality of your test suite.

Code coverage is primarily performed at the unit testing level. Code coverage tools usually express the metric as a percentage, showing you the percentage of successfully validated lines of code in your test procedures, helping you to understand how thoroughly youâ€™re testing your code. 

The importance of code coverage lies in its ability to identify uncovered code that has not been tested and could contain bugs or potential issues not addressed by the test suite. It's important to note that while code coverage is a valuable metric, achieving 100% coverage does not guarantee a bug-free application. It is just one of many tools and practices in a developer's toolkit for ensuring software and code quality.

# **Tools**

There are two types of Code Coverage tools:

- **DataCollectors**: They monitor test execution and collect information about test runs. They report the collected information in various output formats, such as XML and JSON. 
- **Report generators**: They use the data collected from test runs by the DataCollector and generate reports.

## **.NET built-in Code Coverage tool**

.NET includes a built-in code coverage data collector.  To use it, you can use the .NET CLI and run ``dotnet test --collect:"Code Coverage"`` command. 

![code-coverage-native-datacollector](/img/code-coverage-native-datacollector.png)

Collecting Code Coverage like this is a common mistake, because by default this DataCollector analyzes all solution assemblies that are loaded during unit tests, which means that the Unit Test projects will be added into the report.  Thus, it will alter the average Code Coverage percentage, because the Code Coverage percentage in the test projects is always 100%.

To exclude test projecs from the code coverage results and only include application code,  you have 2 options:
Option 1: Add the ExcludeFromCodeCoverageAttribute attribute on your tests csproj, like this:

```xml  
<ItemGroup>
  <AssemblyAttribute Include="System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.ExcludeFromCodeCoverageAttribute" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Option 2: Create a ``.runsettings``that excludes the UnitTests projects from Code Coverage and run ``dotnet test`` command using the ``--settings`` attribute. Like this:
- ``dotnet test --collect:"Code Coverage" --settings codeCoverage.runsettings``

The next code snippet shows a ``.runsettings`` file where all the projects named ``*Tests`` are excluded from the Code Coverage report.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>  
<RunSettings>  
  <!-- Configurations for data collectors -->  
  <DataCollectionRunSettings>  
    <DataCollectors>  
      <DataCollector friendlyName="Code Coverage" uri="datacollector://Microsoft/CodeCoverage/2.0" assemblyQualifiedName="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Coverage.DynamicCoverageDataCollector, Microsoft.VisualStudio.TraceCollector, Version=11.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a">
        <Configuration>  
          <CodeCoverage>  
            <ModulePaths>  
              <!-- Add the name of your test project here -->  
              <Exclude>  
                <ModulePath>.*Tests.dll</ModulePath>  
              </Exclude>  
            </ModulePaths>  
            <!-- We recommend you do not change the following values: -->

            <!-- Set this to True to collect coverage information for functions marked with the "SecuritySafeCritical" attribute. Instead of writing directly into a memory location from such functions, code coverage inserts a probe that redirects to another function, which in turns writes into memory. -->
            <UseVerifiableInstrumentation>True</UseVerifiableInstrumentation>
            <!-- When set to True, collects coverage information from child processes that are launched with low-level ACLs, for example, UWP apps. -->
            <AllowLowIntegrityProcesses>True</AllowLowIntegrityProcesses>
            <!-- When set to True, collects coverage information from child processes that are launched by test or production code. -->
            <CollectFromChildProcesses>True</CollectFromChildProcesses>
            <!-- When set to True, restarts the IIS process and collects coverage information from it. -->
            <CollectAspDotNet>False</CollectAspDotNet>
            <!-- When set to True, static native instrumentation will be enabled. -->
            <EnableStaticNativeInstrumentation>True</EnableStaticNativeInstrumentation>
            <!-- When set to True, dynamic native instrumentation will be enabled. -->
            <EnableDynamicNativeInstrumentation>True</EnableDynamicNativeInstrumentation>
            <!-- When set to True, instrumented binaries on disk are removed and original files are restored. -->
            <EnableStaticNativeInstrumentationRestore>True</EnableStaticNativeInstrumentationRestore>
          </CodeCoverage>  
        </Configuration>  
      </DataCollector>  
    </DataCollectors>  
  </DataCollectionRunSettings>  
</RunSettings>  
```

This data collector generates Code Collector report in a binary ``.coverage`` file. This file is not human-readable at all. What can we do with it? It can be used to generate reports in Visual Studio. 

Here's how it looks if we open the resulting ``.coverage`` file with Visual Studio.

> To open the ``.coverage`` files with Visual Studio, you're going to need Visual Studio Enterprise edtion.

![code-coverage-vs-coverage](/img/code-coverage-vs-coverage.png)

Another option to collect Code Coverage using the .NET built-in collector apart from the .NET CLI is to directly use Visual Studio (to collect code coverage using Visual Studio you also need **Visual Studio Enterprise edition**), just select the ``Test > Analyze Code Coverage for All Tests`` option. 

![code-coverage-vs-test](/img/code-coverage-vs-test.png)


## **Coverlet**

Coverlet is an alternative to the built-in data collector we have discussed previously. It generates test results as human-readable Cobertura XML files, which can then be used to generate HTML reports.

In fact, it is the most used and well-known Code Coverage data collector, a proof of that is the official .NET xUnit test project template comes with Coverlet already integrated.

Just try it, create a new XUnit project using the .NET CLI command: ``dotnet new xunit``, and then inspect the resulting .csproj, you'll see that the [Coverlet NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/coverlet.collector) is already installed in the project.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>

    <IsPackable>false</IsPackable>
    <IsTestProject>true</IsTestProject>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk" Version="17.6.0" />
    <PackageReference Include="xunit" Version="2.4.2" />
    <PackageReference Include="xunit.runner.visualstudio" Version="2.4.5">
      <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>
      <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
    </PackageReference>
    <PackageReference Include="coverlet.collector" Version="6.0.0">
      <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>
      <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
    </PackageReference>
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```
Once the Coverlet package is installed in the Unit Test project, you can collect Code Coverage using the ``dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"`` command.  
The data collector will generate a Cobertura XML file. **The Cobertura format is often used as a standard format for Code Coverage reports.**

If you try to run the ``dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"`` command without having the ``Coverlet.Collector`` installed on your Unit Tests projects, no Code Coverage will be collected at all and you'll get a nice warning.

```shell
Data collection : Unable to find a datacollector with friendly name 'XPlat Code Coverage'.
Data collection : Could not find data collector 'XPlat Code Coverage'
```

The output format of the Code Coverage report can be changed using the ``Format`` parameter. The supported formats are ``lcov``, ``opencover``, ``cobertura``, ``teamcity`` and ``json``.

Here's an example:

``dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage;Format=json"``

Also, it is even possible to specify the coverage output in multiple formats.

``dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage;Format=json,cobertura"``

## **dotCover**

dotCover is a .NET Code Coverage tool (among other things) built by Jetbrains. It works with Visual Studio if you have a Jetbrains license, but it is also available as a free [.NET CLI global tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/JetBrains.dotCover.CommandLineTools).

You can install it using the following .NET CLI command:
- ``dotnet tool install --global JetBrains.dotCover.CommandLineTools``

One of the advantages over the previous one we have discussed is that dotCover is capable of building a human-readable report from the get-go, with ``Coverlet`` or the .NET native collector you end up having a code coverage report in a Cobertura XML format or JSON or Coverage file, and you need a secondary tool to make it human-readable (Visual Studio, report generator tool, etc).

To collect Code Coverage with it, run the following command:
- ``dotnet dotcover cover-dotnet --output=coverage.html --reporttype=HTML -- test ./test/StrategyPatternWithDIExamples.Tests/StrategyPatternWithDIExamples.Tests.csproj``

![code-coverage-dotcover-run](/img/code-coverage-dotcover-run.png)

With the ``reporttype`` option we set the Code Coverage report to HTML, so once the command has finished, a nice HTML coverage report will be created for us. dotCover is capable of create the coverage report in other formats apart from html, like JSON, XML, DetailedXML, NDependXML, SummaryXML, FileCoverageXML and FileCoverageJson.

The next screenshot shows an example of the generated Code Coverage HTML report. 

![code-coverage-dotcover-report](/img/code-coverage-dotcover-report.png)


## **dotnet-coverage**

The ``dotnet-coverage`` tool is a cross-platform tool that can collect code coverage data. 

To install it, use  the ``dotnet tool install`` command: 
- ``dotnet tool install --global dotnet-coverage``

To collect Code Coverage from your tests, just run the command: 
- ``dotnet-coverage collect dotnet test -f cobertura -o coverage.xml``. 

The ``-o`` option sets the code coverage report output file and the ``-f`` option sets the output file format. Supported formats are ``coverage``, ``xml``, and ``cobertura``.


Another useful feature this tool is capable to is to convert from a coverage report format to another, for example, you can covert a ``.coverage`` file to a ``cobertura`` XML file, simply by running the command:
``dotnet-coverage merge -f cobertura -o cobertura.xml 61935778-bdd8-4758-959c-94fdd6a8a376.coverage``

This can be useful if you have some Code Coverage reports collected using Visual Studio and want to convert it into a more standard format. 


## **OpenCover**

[OpenCover](https://github.com/OpenCover/opencover) is another Code Coverage tool for the .NET Framework. 

This tool has ceased development and is no longer maintained, it is better to stick with one of the other tools we have mentioned in this post.


# **Generate reports**

In the previous sections we have covered a bunch of Code Coverage Data Collector that we're able to collect Code Coverage data from unit test runs.

With the exception of dotCover that is capable of built HTML report from the get-go, the Code Coverage data collected is in a format that is not human friendly at all 

Now it is time to convert the Code Coverage reports generated by Coverlet into human readable report.

For this purpose, we will use the [ReportGenerator](https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator) tool. This tool is capable of convert multi Code Coverage formats (Coverlet, OpenCover, dotCover, Visual Studio, NCover, Cobertura, gcov, lcov among other) into a nice readable report.

 To install the ReportGenerator NuGet package as a .NET global tool, use the dotnet tool install command:
 - ``dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool``

 Now let's try to generate a report using the Code Coverage data collected with the tools we've covered in the previous sections.

### **Generate a report from a ``.coverage`` file**

If we try to generate a report using ReportGenerator from the ``.coverage`` file, it won't work.

![code-coverage-rg-coverage](/img/code-coverage-rg-coverage.png)

We have to convert the ``.coverage`` file to another format first. If you follow the [help link](https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator/wiki/Visual-Studio-Coverage-Tools#codecoverageexe)) shown in the error, it tells you to convert it using the ``vstest.console.exe`` application, this comes with Visual Studio, but this process is kind of bad.

A much more easy way to convert it to XML is to use the ``merge`` command from the ``dotnet-coverage`` tool, like this:
- ``dotnet-coverage merge -f xml -o coverage.xml test/StrategyPatternWithDIExamples.Tests/TestResults/da55597e-25e5-4272-a01f-4ce1ef0f84da/108ca3fa-2cc0-4550-a50e-00d9090ab200.coverage``

And now we can generate the report without any problem using ReportGenerator.

![code-coverage-rg-coverage-xml](/img/code-coverage-rg-coverage-xml)

The next screenshot shows the result:

![code-coverage-rg-coverage-report](/img/code-coverage-rg-coverage-report.png)

### **Generate a report from a Cobertura XML file**

Generating a report from a Cobertura XML file is simpler than trying to create one from a ``.coverage`` file.

Simply run the following ``reportgeenerator`` commmand:
- ``reportgenerator -reports:test/StrategyPatternWithDIExamples.Tests/TestResults/coverage.cobertura.xml -reportTypes:Html -targetdir:reports/cobertura/``

And you can see in the next screenshot the generated report.

# **Create a Code Coverage report when building a container image**

Working with containers and external tools can sometimes can be tricky, so in this section, I want to check if it is possible to create a Code Coverage report inside a container using the multiple tools we have seen in the previous sections.

For this purpose I have created the following Dockerfile, which collects Code Coverage metrics using the 4 tools we've seen in the last section (``coverlet``, ``dotCover``, ``dotnet-coverage`` and the native .NET collector).

```yml
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0-jammy AS build-env
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies for dotnet-coverage
RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y install \
     build-essential libxml2

# Install dotcover and dotnet-coverage
RUN dotnet tool install --global JetBrains.dotCover.CommandLineTools \
 && dotnet tool install --global dotnet-coverage


# Set the dotnet tools folder in the PATH env variable
ENV PATH="${PATH}:/root/.dotnet/tools"

# Copy everything
COPY . ./

# Restore packages
RUN dotnet restore -s "https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" \
	--arch x64

# Build project
RUN dotnet build "./src/StrategyPatternWithDIExamples.csproj" \ 
    --configuration Release \
	--self-contained true \
	--arch x64

# Build code coverage report with dotcover
RUN dotnet-dotCover cover-dotnet \
  --output=/app/coverage/dotcover/coverage.html \
  --reporttype=HTML -- test "./test/StrategyPatternWithDIExamples.Tests/StrategyPatternWithDIExamples.Tests.csproj"

# Build code coverage report with dotnet-coverage
RUN dotnet-coverage collect "dotnet test ./test/StrategyPatternWithDIExamples.Tests/StrategyPatternWithDIExamples.Tests.csproj" \
  -f xml \
  -o "/app/coverage/dotnetcoverage/coverage.xml"

# Build code coverage report with native collector
RUN dotnet test "./test/StrategyPatternWithDIExamples.Tests/StrategyPatternWithDIExamples.Tests.csproj" \
	--no-restore \
	--collect:"Code Coverage" \
	--results-directory /app/coverage/native
 
# Build code coverage report with coverlet
RUN dotnet test "./test/StrategyPatternWithDIExamples.Tests/StrategyPatternWithDIExamples.Tests.csproj" \
	--no-restore \
	--collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" \
	--results-directory /app/coverage/coverlet  

# Publish app
RUN dotnet publish "./src/StrategyPatternWithDIExamples.csproj" \
	--configuration Release \
	--output /app/publish \
	--self-contained true \
	--arch x64

# Build runtime image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime-deps:8.0.0-jammy

# Copy artifact
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build-env /app/publish .
COPY --from=build-env /app/coverage /app/coverage

# Starts on port 8080
ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:8080

# Set Entrypoint
ENTRYPOINT ["./StrategyPatternWithDIExamples"]
```

There are some things worth mentioning from this experiment.  

- The ``dotnet-coverage`` doesn't work right from get-go, if we take a look at the Dockerfile logs, we can see the following message when trying to collect Code Coverage with the ``dotnet-coverage`` tool.

![code-coverage-dotnet-coverage-deps](/img/code-coverage-dotnet-coverage-deps.png)

To fix it, we must install the following dependencies.

```yml
RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y install build-essential libxml2
```

- The ``dotCover`` also gave me some problems when running it using the ```dotnet dotcover cover-dotnet`` command. To fix it I switch to the ``dotnet-dotCover cover-dotnet`` command.


After the couple of mentioned above, the 4 tools (``coverlet``, ``dotCover``, ``dotnet-coverage`` and native .NET collector) successfully created a Code Coverage report. 


# **View Code Coverage reports on SonarQube and CodeCov**

Having a single place where keeping track of the Code Coverage metric of your application provides several benefits.

Like having a detailed view of your code quality, helping you identify areas of your code that need improvement. It can help you spot bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities.  By uploading your code coverage metrics, you can easily track which parts of your code are not covered by tests. This can help you improve your test coverage and thus the reliability of your application.

There are quite a few products capable of keeping track of application Code Coverage metric, but I will make focus on probably the 2 most well-known: ``SonarQube`` and ``CodeCov``.

## **SonarQube / SonarCloud**

SonarQube does not generate the coverage report itself. 

Instead, you must set up a third-party tool to produce the report as part of your build process. SonarQube supports the following .NET test coverage tools:

- Visual Studio Code Coverage
- dotnet-coverage Code Coverage
- dotCover
- OpenCover
- Coverlet

You then need to configure your analysis to tell the SonarScanner where the report is located so that it can pick it up and send it to SonarQube, where it will be displayed on your project dashboard along with the other analysis metrics.

The process to send Code Coverage to SonarQube is quite simple:
- Generate the Code Coverage report using one of the tools we discussed in the previous sections
- Use the SonarScanner tool to upload it to SonarQube.

The SonarScanner for .NET comes in four major variants: .NET Framework, .NET Core, .NET Global Tool, and the Azure Pipelines extension. For a quick test we're going to use the SonarScanner .NET Global tool.

To install, just run the following command:
- ``dotnet tool install --global dotnet-sonarscanner``

To generate the Code Coverage report, I decided to use ``dotCover`` (but you could use any other).

```text
dotnet sonarscanner begin /k:"code-coverage-test"
    /d:sonar.login="<sonar-token>"
    /d:sonar.cs.dotcover.reportsPaths=coverage.html

dotnet dotcover cover-dotnet --output=coverage.html --reporttype=HTML -- test ./test/StrategyPatternWithDIExamples.Tests/StrategyPatternWithDIExamples.Tests.csproj

dotnet sonarscanner end /d:sonar.login="<sonar-token>"
```


## **CodeCov**


# **Publish Code Coverage reports on Azure Pipelines and Github Actions**
